            I am Yousef Alqahtani, majoring in MIS at University of Nebraska at Omaha(UNO). Computers has always been a fascination to me and I believe we could do a lot of amazing things with them.
            This led me to develop keen interest towards learning programming.I like writing programs in 'Java' to do small tasks.And the first programming language I have learned was 'C'.
